# (Carbon Dioxide Emission)
## by Shrouk Reda


## Dataset

> This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.
There are total 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here.

> Model
4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
AWD = All-wheel drive
FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
SWB = Short wheelbase
LWB = Long wheelbase
EWB = Extended wheelbase

> Transmission
A = Automatic
AM = Automated manual
AS = Automatic with select shift
AV = Continuously variable
M = Manual
3 - 10 = Number of gears

> Fuel type
X = Regular gasoline
Z = Premium gasoline
D = Diesel
E = Ethanol (E85)
N = Natural gas

> Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per gallon (mpg)

>CO2 Emissions
The tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving.


## Summary of Findings

> As number of miles a vehicle can travel with one gallon increases carbon Emissions decreases. Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg) is negatively corelated with CO2 Emissions
> We can see that Large size engines consumes more fuel and emitt large amount of carbon emissions.
> We can observe that as per gallon number of miles a vehicle travels increases carbon emissions decreases. It implies that less fuel consumption vehicles emitt less carbon emissions. 
> Ethanol emitts more amount of carbon dioxide.
> we can observe that the most used type of fuel is Regular gasoline (X) and there is NO cars in this dataset uses Natural gas (N).
> We can observe that the SUV-SMALL class is the most pouplar in this dataset.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> **We can observe that most of the costly brand cars like BUGATTI and LAMBORGHINI are emmitting lot of carbon emissions and brands like HONDA and FIAT are least carbon emitting vehicles.**
> **We can see that Large size engines consumes more fuel and emitt large amount of carbon emissions.**
> **we can observe that the higher the number of cylinders,  the higher the CO2 emissions.**
